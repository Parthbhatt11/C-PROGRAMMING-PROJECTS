# Periodic Table Explorer in C

A command-line tool built with C that provides basic information about the first 118 elements of the periodic table. This project serves as a simple database application, demonstrating the use of `switch-case` statements to retrieve and display specific data based on user input.

## Features

This program allows you to:

-   **Explore Elements:** Look up an element by its atomic number to get key information.
-   **View Element Details:** For a given atomic number, the program displays the following information:
    -   Element Name
    -   Symbol
    -   Atomic Weight
    -   Category (e.g., Noble Gas, Alkali Metal)
    -   Founder/Discoverer
    -   A fun fact about the element

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

-   A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation

1.  Save the code as `periodic_table.c`.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Compile the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc periodic_table.c -o periodic_table
    ```

### Execution

After successful compilation, run the executable from your terminal:

```bash
./periodic_table

Technical Details
Data Structure: The program uses a large switch-case block to store and retrieve data for each element. This approach is straightforward for a fixed set of data points.

User Interface: The interface is purely command-line driven, using printf() for output and scanf() for input, providing a simple and direct user experience.

Program Flow: A while(1) loop ensures the program continues to run and allows users to look up multiple elements until they choose to exit.

Limitations
Hardcoded Data: All element data is hardcoded directly into the source file. For a larger or more dynamic application, it would be better to store this data in a separate file or a more flexible data structure.

Basic Functionality: The program's sole function is to display pre-defined information. It does not perform calculations or allow for adding/modifying element data.

Contributing

This project can be a great starting point for beginners in C. Feel free to fork the repository and expand its functionality. Some ideas for improvement include:

Storing element data in a file (.csv or binary) for easier management.

Adding more information for each element (e.g., melting point, boiling point).

Allowing users to search by element name or symbol.

Adding interactive quizzes or games related to the periodic table.
